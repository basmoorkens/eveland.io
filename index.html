					<h2 style="border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style:solid; border-bottom-color:#00B906;">How does it work?</h2>
					<p>
						Eveland.io operates on a model where private investors can invest into the company after mandatory KYC verification by purchasing EVO tokens.<br />
						Instead of a traditional stake in the company you are investing into blockchain tokens based off the Stellar blockchain.
						The benefit of this model is that Eveland.io gets added funds to invest into completing real estate projects and in return the token will appreciate
						in value because each token is backed by the real estate that gets completed by <strong>Eveland.io</strong>. 
					</p>
					
					<h2 style="font-size:28px;">How to participate?</h2>

						<h3>Token creation</h3>
						<p>
							Tokens are created when a property is purchased.  The number of tokens authorized is calculated by dividing the developed value of the property by the current book value.  For example 91 Evelyn will be worth 2 million when it is developed and the current book value per token is 10 cents therefore 20,000,000 tokens are authorized.

					<div class="feature-center">
						<span class="icon">
							<i class="ti-money"></i>
						</span>
						<h3>Token value</h3>
						<p>
							The current book value is calculated by dividing the most recent appraised value of the property by the total number of authorized tokens.  For example 91 Evelyn with the proposed new home completed appraises for $2,000,000. There are 20,000,000 authorized tokens.  2 million dollars divided by 20 million tokens is $0.10 for the current book value.  This is the number that we guarantee to buy back the tokens upon request.

				<div class="col-md-4  col-sm-2">
					<div class="feature-center">
						<span class="icon">
							<i class="ti-pulse"></i>
						</span>
						<h3>Liquidity</h3>
						<p>
							Eveland.io keeps a cash reserve of 10% of issued tokens and posts a trade at localstellarassets.com to purchase at current book value.  We also have a buy offer on the stellar decentralized exchange at current book value. This makes it easy to withdraw funds quickly and with no fees.

						<h3>Goal</h3>
						<p>
							Our goal is to add value to the fund through entitlements and development with a minimum return of 10% per year.  There is no guarantee of this and if the price of real estate goes down so does the value of the token.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-4 col-sm-2">
					<div class="feature-center">
						<span class="icon">
							<i class="ti-search"></i>
						</span>
						<h3>Token details</h3>
						<p>
							The token for Eveland.io is based on the Stellar blockchain (www.stellar.org) but accounts for holding the token are limited to accredited and other approved investors who are interested in investing in Eveland.io investment fund (just like in a publicly traded REIT). The investment is as liquid as a bank account but with returns higher than a bank offers. These enable investors to stake their money with low risk for development projects that involve buying land, increasing value by getting entitlements, increasing value by building, and holding and managing properties.

					<div class="feature-center">
						<span class="icon">
							<i class="ti-wallet"></i>
						</span>
						<h3>Payouts</h3>
						<p>
							We do not pay dividends or provide disbursements. Revenue from rental property is used to expand and increase the value of our portfolio and therefore the value of the token. You can simply cash out by selling (part) of your tokens.
							Our intention is to keep this process simple and provide a safe place for investors to put their capital.  The goal is for it to be as easy as depositing money in the bank with the added advantage of a much higher yield.

						<h3>Founder</h3>
						<p>
							Eveland.io was inspired and founded by Garth Wells, a general contractor with 25 years of experience in building and remodeling homes in the Bay Area California, to enable him to continue doing what he loves – building cool things – regardless of how the market was or the lending practices of banks at that time. As a cryptocurrency enthusiast, Garth realized that integrating cryptocurrencies into real estate by utilizing digital tokens as a means of funding was just the solution he needed and so [Business] was established.
